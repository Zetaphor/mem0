## How to set custom categories?

Users now have the ability to create custom categories tailored to their unique needs, in addition to the default categories like travel, sports, music, and others.
Additionally, a filtering option allows users to choose whether to extend or omit specific categories to limit their scope.
To set up custom categories, users must provide a category name and a description explaining its purpose. The filter is an optional feature that supports the keywords: **extend**, **omit**, and **restrict**.

Here we initialize the Memory with config.

```python
from mem0 import Memory

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "max_tokens": 1500,
        }
    },
    "version": "v1.1"
}

m = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config, user_id="alice")
```
### Example

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
custom_categories = {
    "categories" : [
        {"financial": "Includes content related to personal finance, investing strategies, saving tips, market trends, and financial planning."},
        {"programming": "For users interested in programming, including tutorials, coding tips, language-specific content, and software development best practices."}
    ], 
    "filter": "restrict" # or can be; extend, omit
}

m.add("Alice enjoys hiking, favors using Python for backend development, and prefers budgeting apps to manage her finances.", user_id="alice1", custom_categories=custom_categories)
m.add("Alice is passionate about front-end development with React and spends her weekends exploring new restaurants.", user_id="alice1", custom_categories=custom_categories)
m.add("Alice loves reading historical fiction, excels in writing efficient Python scripts, and is an avid traveler.", user_id="alice1", custom_categories=custom_categories)
m.add("Alice is a fan of indie films and enjoys practicing yoga.", user_id="alice1", custom_categories=custom_categories)

def extract_memories(data):
    return [item['memory'] for item in data['results']]

res = m.get_all(user_id="alice1")
print(extract_memories(res))
```

```python Output
Passionate about front-end development with React
Alice excels in writing efficient Python scripts
Prefers budgeting apps to manage her finances
Name is Alice
Favors using Python for backend development
```

## Filters

- `extend` Adds the custom category alongside the default categories, expanding the available options.

- `omit`  Excludes the custom category from the selection, narrowing the available choices.

- `restrict` Limits the selection to the custom category, excluding all default categories.

## Default Categories
Here is the list of **default categories**. Ensure you review these before creating custom categories to prevent duplication.
